# Governance

## Overview

Architect governance describes the various roles and their responsibilities, how we make decisions, and how to find us.

## Roles & their responsibilities

- Contributor - open source community member; there is so much more to open source than code. filing a bug is probably one of the most valuable ways you can contribute. writing a blog post is contributing. helping out others online or even just chilling in Discord is contributing. we value our community and recognize all forms of contribution.
- Maintainer - can commit and cut a release of an Architect repository
- Core Maintainer - can release architect/architect primary project
- Arbiter - a Core Maintainer with final authority for Architect project decision making; rotating annually on the first of January.

## Who we are

### Core

- Ryan Block, Arbiter

### Maintainers


- Kristofer Joseph
- Ryan Bethel
- Taylor Beseda
- Simon MacDonald 

## How we make decisions

The Architect project Maintainers use rough consensus to make decisions. We have an overarching goal for the project to be stable, which is to say retaining backwards compatibility as a primary responsibility. Getting started should always remain frictionless and, hopefully, fun. Upgrading and day-to-day rote maintenance should be entirely opt-in and non-destructive.
