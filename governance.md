# Governance

## Overview

Architect governance describes the various roles and their responsibilities, how we make decisions, and how to find us.


## Roles & their responsibilities

- **Contributor** - Open source community member; there is so much more to open source than code. Filing a bug is probably one of the most valuable ways you can contribute. Writing a blog post is contributing. Helping out others online or even just chilling in Discord is contributing. We value our community and recognize all forms of contribution.
- **Maintainer** - Can commit and cut a release of an Architect project & repository
- **Core Maintainer** - Responsible for longer-term vision & high-level technical decision-making; can release core `@architect/architect` project
- **Arbiter** - Core Maintainer with tie-breaking authority for Architect project decision-making; role rotates annually on Jan 1.


## Who we are

### Core

- Ryan Block, Arbiter (2022)
- Brian LeRoux
- Fil Maj


### Maintainers

- Kristofer Joseph
- Ryan Bethel
- Taylor Beseda
- Simon MacDonald


## How we make decisions

The Architect project Maintainers & Core Maintainers use rough consensus to make decisions. We have an overarching goal for the project to be stable, prioritizing backwards compatibility as a primary responsibility.

Getting started should always remain frictionless and, hopefully, fun. Upgrading and day-to-day rote maintenance should be entirely opt-in and non-destructive.
